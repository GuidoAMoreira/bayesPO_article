## Purpose

This repository contains the code from the paper Analysis of Presence-only data via Exact Bayes, with Model and Effects Identification.

## Dependencies

The R packages that are required for the simulated datasets, i.e., all files starting with *sim_* are [`bayesPO`](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira/bayesPO), `Rcpp`, `bayesplot`, `ggplot2`, `foreach` and `doParallel`.

The Ox command line software version 7, available at (https://www.doornik.com/) is necessary for running the real datasets estimations.
